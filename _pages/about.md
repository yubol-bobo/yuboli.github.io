I am a PhD student in Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by [Rema Padman](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/faculty-research/profiles/padman-rema/) and [Ramayya Krishnan](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/faculty-research/profiles/krishnan-ramayya). My research advances cutting-edge AI systems and their deployment in interdisciplinary fields, with a particular focus on multi-turn LLM interactions, agentic AI systems, and explainability of LLMs and deep learning models in healthcare.

My work centers on developing aligned AI and LLM systems that enable reliable, personalized treatment and clinical decision-making. By ensuring these models provide clinicians with dependable and transparent recommendations, I aim to transform healthcare decisions and reshape interactions between doctors and patients.

Throughout my research journey, I have tackled complex healthcare challenges, including developing agentic QA systems for organ transplant patients, LLM alignment and bias evaluation/mitigation, predictive analysis for chronic kidney disease, and explainable AI for chronic disease management. My expertise spans Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP/LLMs, and Generative Recommendation Systems, refined through collaborations with leading faculty/researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and UC San Diego.

I am constantly exploring opportunities to push the boundaries of AI research, developing systems that transform human-AI collaboration with a priority on safety and reliability for seamless adoption in high-stakes domain applications.
